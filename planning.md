# The Big Cane Rum - Experimental Project Planning

## Project Overview
Creating an enhanced version of The Big Cane Rum website with a vibrant party atmosphere, premium nightclub aesthetic, and interactive elements that emphasize the brand's luxurious yet energetic character.

## Current State Assessment
